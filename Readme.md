# Machine Learning & A.I.
This repository contains some of my earlier projects in the field of classical machine learning and deep learning. The projects utilizes tools and technologies for data scinece and ML such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, scikit-learn, keras and tensorflow.

1. ### Digit Recognizer  
This [notebook](https://github.com/divyaprakash0426/Machine-Learning-AI/tree/master/image_prediction) uses a dimensionality reduction manifold learning algorithm called Isomap to visualize the points in 64-dimensional parameter space, reduced down to 2 dimensions, using an unsupervised method.

2. ### House Prices Prediction  
This [notebook](https://github.com/divyaprakash0426/Machine-Learning-AI/tree/master/data_analysis) is an example of the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) step as part of the Data Science process. The notebook further explores some advanced regression techniques such as Lasso, XGBoost on the Ames Housing Dataset. Achieved MAE of 0.08.

3. ### IMDB Reviews Sentiment Analysis  
This [notebook](https://github.com/divyaprakash0426/Machine-Learning-AI/tree/master/sentiment_analysis) uses Keras framework to build and train a neural network that analyzes text for sentiment. The result is a 5-layer sequential neural network with adam optimizer optimizing binary cross-entropy loss.   
Achieved accuracy score of 88%.

4. ### Text Classifier  
This [notebook](https://github.com/divyaprakash0426/Machine-Learning-AI/tree/master/sentiment_analysis) exploits a multinomial naive Bayes classification machine learning model to separate input text into one of 20 distinct categories with an accuracy of 83%. It is surprising how such a simple algorithm can yield such impressive results.

5. ### Image Predictor  
This [notebook](https://github.com/divyaprakash0426/Machine-Learning-AI/tree/master/image_prediction) uses tensorflow and keras to construct a 5-layer sequential convolutional neural network to identify clothing types in the MNIST for Fashion dataset.
